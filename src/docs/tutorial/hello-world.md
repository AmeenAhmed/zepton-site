Welcome to the Zepton tutorial. This will teach you step by step everything you need to build interfaces.

You can always look at the [docs](/docs) or [examples](/examples) if you prefer those.

## What is Zepton?

Zepton is a small and flexible Javascript library for building user interfaces. The core library is less than 1000 lines code, 
around 3.3kb compressed and gzipped. Its fast, it doesn't use a virtual DOM. Components are written in plain old javascript, 
so its familiar and quite flexible.
